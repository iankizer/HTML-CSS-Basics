    <h1>Extras</h1>

  <p>This page is about miscellaneous HTML things, but you may also be
   interested in <a href='../links.html'>links</a> or <a
   href='../images.html'>images</a>.</p>
   <!--Parent Folders: To navigate up through multiple directories, 
   use multiple .. references, like so: ../../elsewhere.html 
   Relative links are nice because they let you move around entire folders 
   without having to update all the href’s on your <a> elements, 
    but they can get a little confusing when all your links start with 
    a bunch of dots. -->

  <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
  <p>There are three reserved characters in HTML: &lt; &gt; and &amp;. You
   should always use HTML entities for these three characters.</p>
   <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
   yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>

    <!--In the olden days of the web, HTML files weren’t allowed to have special 
    characters in them, making entities much more useful. But, since we’re now using a 
    UTF-8 character set, we should be able to insert any character directly into the HTML document. 
    This makes entities primarily useful as reserved characters or for convenience when authoring 
    straight HTML. -->
