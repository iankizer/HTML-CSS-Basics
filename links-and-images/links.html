    <h1>Links</h1>
        
        <p>This example is about links and <a href='images.html'>images</a>.</p>
        <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kinds of links:</p>
        <ul>
            <!-- Add <li> elements here -->
            <li>Absolute links, like to
                <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>Mozilla
                Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web
                developers.</li>
            <li>Relative links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras
                page</a>.</li>
            
            <li>Absolute links with a "target=" to open a new tab, like to <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
            target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good 
            resource for web developers.</li>
            <!-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->

             <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website,
             but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>

        </ul>
            <!-- “Absolute” links are the most detailed way you can 
             refer to a web resource. They start with the “scheme” (typically 
             http:// or https://), followed by the domain name of the website, 
             then the path of the target web page.
             "Scheme": HTTPs://
             "Domain" Developer.Mozilla.Org
             "Path": /EN-US/DOCS/WEB/HTML

             -->
             <!--"Relative Links"“Relative” links point to another file in your website 
            from the vantage point of the file you’re editing. It’s implied that the
            scheme and domain name are the same as the current page, so the only thing 
            you need to supply is the path.-->

            <!--“Root-relative” links are similar to the previous 
            section, but instead of being relative to the current page, they’re relative 
            to the “root” of the entire website. For instance, if your website is hosted 
            on our-site.com, all root-relative URLs will be relative to our-site.com.
            -The only difference between a root-relative link and a relative one is that the 
            former starts with a forward slash. That initial forward slash represents the 
            root of your site. You can add more folders and files to the path after that 
            initial slash, just like relative links. Root-relative links are some of the 
            most useful kinds of links. They’re explicit enough to avoid the potential confusion 
            of relative links, but they’re not overly explicit like absolute links. -->

            <!--Target Attributes" The target attribute has a few pre-defined values that carry special
             meaning for web browsers, but the most common one is _blank, which specifies a new tab or 
             window. -->
